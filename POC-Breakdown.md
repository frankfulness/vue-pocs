# Steps

1. Scaffold all 3 projects (1 is stretch)
2. Add the libraries to each project (validate the runs)
3. Figure out what is a great Accessibilty Paradigm for Ui to determine what components to use in all 3.
4. Identify from the pros and cons of each, how the project can test all of them in same project.
5. Hit a few cons from the research we have done.
  - TypeScript
  - How difficult is it to go backward or swap out, the level of dependency.
  - Test frameworks & styling practical details.
  - Consistency with documentation, helpful?
  - Learning curve, adaptability, velocity
