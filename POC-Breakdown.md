# ‚õ∞Ô∏è Steps

1. Scaffold all 3 projects (1 is stretch)
2. Add the libraries to each project (validate the runs)
3. Figure out what is a great Accessibilty Paradigm for Ui to determine what components to use in all 3.
4. Identify from the pros and cons of each, how the project can test all of them in same project.
5. Hit a few cons from the research we have done.

- TypeScript
- How difficult is it to go backward or swap out, the level of dependency.
- Test frameworks & styling practical details.
- Consistency with documentation, helpful?
- Learning curve, adaptability, velocity

Components to use:

1. Tabs
2. Buttons
3. Form with input
4. Props
5. Events
6. Unit test
7. 508 compliance
8. Smaller screen site (consideration)
9. Dark mode / themeing

# ‚öôÔ∏è I. Quasar

## 3 OPTIONS: Quasar CLI, Vite plugin, & Vue CLI Plugin

- So, Quasar CLI you have to create the entire project through this.
- Vite Plugin makes it easy to add, but you lose a lot & all SSR capabilities,
- Vue CLI plugin is in maintenance mode, WARNED to use Quasar CLI

### CLI vs Plugin, Pros & Cons

<https://quasar.dev/start/quasar-cli>

Without CLI you lose SSR, PWA, crossplatform (Electron), better hot reloading/server features, lose preconfig build commands, lose unified configuration, and much more.
Essentially, CLI means project regenerate/rewrite. Vite Plugin means lower quality/support.

The documentation completely lacked in explaining plugin installation. For example:
For installing Vue devtools you have to create a boot/devtools.js file, and update the quasar.config.js file in 4 locations (boot, vitePlugins, framework, & build) after installing the dependency. And though we input everything that we should, we still could not get them in. No documentation provided from Quasar outside Electron. This means, due to inability to install browser extensions, we get NO Vue devtools with this CLI setup.

Quasar Vite-Plugin flavor was easier to set up, but you lose essentially everything Quasar really offers.

# üèéÔ∏è II. PrimeVue + Tailwind

Immediately noticeable how much better/clearer the documentation is than Quasar.

Easy to setup, install TailwindCSS and quickly configure the Vue app.

# üèÅ III. Radix + Tailwind

1. Installation very smooth, easy to jump right into adding components. Component features in documentation specify it's compliance to accessibility.

- Keyboard navigation and Focus management documentation holds up in accessibility: <https://www.radix-vue.com/overview/accessibility.html>

2. TailwindCSS configuration is straight forward. Every component has a link to stackblitz example utilized as well as the tailwindcss config for css transitions, etc.
3. TypeScript is opt in, but only for intellisense for usage of Radix components, simply omit lang='ts' from the `<script>` of a component, easy to add ts later.
4. Testing/TDD, straight forward to work with vitest, wrote a `AccessibilityPlayground.spec.js` test to hit basics of every single component brought in.
5. TODO: 508 compliance, add a accessibility specific unit test
6. TODO: Responsivity implement
7. TODO: Dark/Light theme
8. Radix doesn't have a Data Table component out the box because it acknowledges that there are better table solutions out there, like AG Grid or the underlying TanStack Table v8 (used under the hood of AG Grid). Thus, I did implement a fairly simply tailwind styled TanStack Table in vue showing only a couple of the customizeable tables we can make for free <https://tanstack.com/table/latest/docs/framework/vue/examples/row-selection>

# ü™¥ IV. Nuxt with Nuxt UI

- Quick to generate a Nuxt application. Configuration documentation is straight forward. <https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/configuration>
- It appears Nuxt UI has a decent free version and appears to be the go to for the component library choice for Nuxt. However, there is a Pro/Premium component version of this. <https://ui.nuxt.com/pro/pricing> fortunately it's a one time cost for life for 5 developers, there also appears to be a Figma Kit Pro for the 1500+ component & variants which has Tailwind CSS assets and icons included.
- Can do without TypeScript easily, and for form validation Yup > Zod if no TS.
- Has Table component and implemented it.
